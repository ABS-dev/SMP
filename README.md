SoftMax Pro *example* protocol files for estimating relative potency.  These are **example** files (that need to be carefully adapted for specific products/assays) that were released in early 2014 to illustrate CVBSOP 0102.  These files were formerly available on the vendorâ€™s community sharing website, which no longer exists.  They are now posted here for convenience only and are not actively being supported.  No endorsement, claim, or warranty is implied for these files. They are made available for investigational or pedagogical use only.
